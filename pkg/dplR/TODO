o [mvkorpel] Fix the sty file so that Sweave code adheres to the margins.

* Make an S3 summary method for rwl objects that calls rwl.stats.

* Improve the help file for series.rho.

o [mvkorpel] Write a MAKEFILE for vignettes that removes any of the temp files 
  that get produced when typesetting the vignette pdf? The tex files, etc.
* Actually write the first intro vignette!

* Decide when to use class('rwl') in functions dealing with rwl objects.
  Other than the plot S3Method for rwl, are there cases when having that class
  would be useful. E.g., in error checking?

* Add 'prewhiten' as a detrending method.
  It would be nice to have a prewhitening option to detrend.series
  (and therefore dentrend) that returns white noise 
  This could be as easy as:
    y <- detrend.series(x, method="Mean")
    y <- ar.func(y)
    return(y)

* Dummy item
   This is a sample item.

- Sub-item
   Any number of sub-items can be added.

o [mvkorpel] Another dummy item
   This one shows how to mark a to-do item as assigned to somebody.
   By default, this seems to show the user's login name.  The notation
   is from todoo.el, an Emacs mode for editing TODO files.  Using the
   mode, it is easy to reorder and hide / show items.  Also in the
   mode, headings of items and sub-items are automatically
   highlighted.  It should be easy enough to adhere to the format even
   if the text editor does not support it.
