o[mvkorpel]  Mikko, I started working on the verbose option for detrend.series. 
   There are some things to take care of in there that you can likely do
   better than I can.
-  What is the best way to extract the parameters with ModNegExp?
-  In detrend() the call to detrend.series doesn't appear to pass the names
   in to detrend.series when dopar is invoked. Is that right?
-  Also note that i.detrend will need fixing too for verbose mode.

o[andybunn]  Write more vignettes:
-  Crossdating (started)
-  Spectral and wavelets
-  Advanced chronology building (strip.rwl, etc.)

*  In rwi.stats and any place a correlation is calculated, offer an argument to
   to specify which correlation method (e.g., spearman). Note that this is 
   implemented in interseries.cor - but will have to do this throughout. 
   The default should be spearman.
-   Did this in rwi.stats, corr.rwl.seg, and corr.series.seg but the 
    output names still have "rho" in them. Change?
-   This can't be easily implemented in ccf.series.rwl

* Decide when to use class('rwl') in functions dealing with rwl objects.
  Other than the plot and summary S3Method for rwl, are there cases when 
  having that class would be useful. E.g., in error checking? Same for 
  class('crn'). There is a plot method now. What else?
