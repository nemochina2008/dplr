*  In rwi.stats and any place a correlation is calculated, offer an argument to
   to specify which correlation method (e.g., spearman). Note that this is 
   implemented in interseries.cor - but will have to do this throughout. 
   The default should be spearman.

*  In detrend(method=“ModNegExp”) there should be a verbose option that writes 
   how each series was handled including the parameters of the model.

* Should there be a makefile for vignettes that removes 
  the temp files that get produced when typesetting the vignette pdf? 
  (the tex files and intermediate pdfs, etc.) I've been compiling the 
  vignettes in Rstudio which leaves a lot of junk
  behind when it's done. I made this makefile for my use. I'm not sure if 
  this should sit in the pkg directory or just be for my use. Thoughts?
      output = .output
      rnwfile = intro-dplR
      
      all:
        R CMD Sweave $(rnwfile).Rnw
      	-mkdir $(output)
      	-cp *.sty $(output)
      	-cp *.bib $(output)
      	-mv *.tex *.pdf *.pdf $(output)
      	cd $(output); R CMD texi2pdf $(rnwfile).tex 
      
      clean:
      	-rm $(output)/*
      	-rmdir $(output)

* Decide when to use class('rwl') in functions dealing with rwl objects.
  Other than the plot and summary S3Method for rwl, are there cases when 
  having that class would be useful. E.g., in error checking?

- Consider the benefits and drawbacks of creating classes for chonologies. 
  One benefit would be an S3 plot method for chronologies.

* Add 'prewhiten' as a detrending method.
  It would be nice to have a prewhitening option to detrend.series
  (and therefore dentrend) that returns white noise 
  This could be as easy as:
    y <- detrend.series(x, method="Mean")
    y <- ar.func(y)
    return(y)
