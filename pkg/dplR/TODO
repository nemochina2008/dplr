*  Write more vignettes:
-  Crossdating
-  Spectral and wavelets
-  Advanced chronology building (strip.rwl, etc.)

*  In rwi.stats and any place a correlation is calculated, offer an argument to
   to specify which correlation method (e.g., spearman). Note that this is 
   implemented in interseries.cor - but will have to do this throughout. 
   The default should be spearman.

*  In detrend.series there should be a verbose option that writes 
   how a series is handled including the parameters of the model.
- Things to keep track of (not in order): 
    1. Number of zero values and where they are are (what years). 
    2. What method is being used
    3. For the method the relevant parameters. E.g., at params of an nls model,
       ar coef, etc.
    4. What else?

* Decide when to use class('rwl') in functions dealing with rwl objects.
  Other than the plot and summary S3Method for rwl, are there cases when 
  having that class would be useful. E.g., in error checking? Same for 
  class('crn'). There is a plot method now. What else?
