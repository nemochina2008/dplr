o[andybunn]  xskel.cff.plot is a renamed version of skel.cff.plot which has been taken 
   out of the package. I think. The x preface is to denote its use
   in crossdating. This function needs to have checks built in that will allow
   it to be used on rwl and crn objects (for the master).
-  The relative growth calculation in for this plot has been moved to
   its own function called xskel.calc in helpers.R
_  I will make a version without the ccf plots as well "xskel.plot."

o[mvkorpel]  Finish the verbose option for detrend.series and it's bretheren
   (e.g., detrend, i.detrend.series, i.detrend). Better yet, should we 
   depricate the i.detrend functions and have "interactive" be an argument
   to detrend?

o[mvkorpel] Should we use class('rwl) as a way of error checking? 
   E.g.,when a function has "rwl" as an argument should there be a check:
      if (!inherits(rwl, "rwl")) {
          stop('use only with "rwl" objects')
- Related: We should have functions is.rwl() and as.rwl() 

o[andybunn]  Write more vignettes:
-  Spectral and wavelets
-  Advanced chronology building (strip.rwl, etc.)
