*  Think about how to make better use of the skeleton plotting concept.
   I want to make better use of skeleton plotting and the curent plot 
   (while pretty) is not especially useful. That is why I made the 
   skel.ccf.plot function. That function is very useful for crossdating in R
   while skel.plot is useful only when the plots are printed (and then only
   to folks who are trained in interpreting them). Should we deprecate the
   existing skel.plot function and make it skel.plot.legacy? I'd prefer to
   replace it with something like skel.ccf.plot but without the ccf plots.
   But, that plot (and skel.ccf.plot) should be able to take an rwl object
   or a crn obejct to calculate the master. This will take some thought.
-  Regardless: Move the relative growth calculation in skel plot to its own function
   called skel.calc
_  skel.calc would be called by skel.ccf.plotm skel.plot.legacy, etc.

o[mvkorpel]  Finish the verbose option for detrend.series and it's bretheren
   (e.g., detrend, i.detrend.series, i.detrend). Better yet, should we 
   depricate the i.detrend functions and have "interactive" be an argument
   to detrend?

o[mvkorpel] Should we use class('rwl) as a way of error checking? 
   E.g.,when a function has "rwl" as an argument should there be a check:
      if (!inherits(rwl, "rwl")) {
          stop('use only with "rwl" objects')
- Related: We should have functions is.rwl() and as.rwl() 

o[andybunn]  Write more vignettes:
-  Spectral and wavelets
-  Advanced chronology building (strip.rwl, etc.)
