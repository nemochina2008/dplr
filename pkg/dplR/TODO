*  In rwi.stats and any place a correlation is calculated, offer an argument to
   to specify which correlation method (e.g., spearman). Note that this is 
   implemented in interseries.cor - but will have to do this throughout. 
   The default should be spearman.

*  In detrend(method=“ModNegExp”) there should be a verbose option that writes 
   how each series was handled including the parameters of the model.

* Decide when to use class('rwl') in functions dealing with rwl objects.
  Other than the plot and summary S3Method for rwl, are there cases when 
  having that class would be useful. E.g., in error checking? Same for 
  class('crn'). There is a plot method now. What else?

o [andybunn] Keep old argument names for backward compatibility?
   Users may call the affected functions with named arguments.  The
   (wrapper) method for the generic function must use the argument
   name of the generic, but the actual function, familiar to users of
   previous versions of dplR, should arguably use the old name.
   
- crn.plot (plot.crn): crn vs x

- rwl.stats (summary.rwl): rwl vs object

o [andybunn] Vignette: Which article, a or an, for rwl? Now both are used.
   Is rwl read as "ring width length", so should it be "a"?

o [andybunn] Vignette: Check that rbar.tot is correct.
   In "This number is typically higher than rbar.tot", there used to
   be rbar instead of rbar.tot. I (Mikko) tried to be more explicit
   about which number should be compared. Please check that this makes
   sense.

o [andybunn] Vignette: Use either "dataset" or "data set" exclusively.
   The former is used more often in .Rd files of the package.
