o[mvkorpel] In the crossdating functions that take foo(rwl,series) it would be nice to
  have the user be able to use a series name or index instead of the rwl object
  instead of subsetting the rwl object itself. For instance, right now to use
  the ccf crossdating function a user does this:
    data(co021)
    dat <- co021
    flagged <- dat$"641143"
    names(flagged) <- rownames(dat)
    dat$"641143" <- NULL
    ccf.100 <- ccf.series.rwl(rwl = dat, series = flagged, seg.length = 100)

  It would be better if they could just do this:
    ccf.100 <- ccf.series.rwl(rwl = dat, series = "641143", seg.length = 100)
  Or this:
    ccf.100 <- ccf.series.rwl(rwl = dat, series.index = 4, seg.length = 100)

o[mvkorpel]  Mikko, I started working on the verbose option for detrend.series. 
   There are some things to take care of in there that you can likely do
   better than I can.
-  What is the best way to extract the parameters with ModNegExp?
-  In detrend() the call to detrend.series doesn't appear to pass the names
   in to detrend.series when dopar is invoked. Is that right?
-  Also note that i.detrend will need fixing too for verbose mode.

o[andybunn]  Write more vignettes:
-  Spectral and wavelets
-  Advanced chronology building (strip.rwl, etc.)

*  Move the relative growth calculation in skel plot to its own function
   called skel.calc. I want to make better use of skeleton plotting and the 
   curent plot (while pretty) is not especially useful.

* Decide when to use class('rwl') in functions dealing with rwl objects.
  Other than the plot and summary S3Method for rwl, are there cases when 
  having that class would be useful. E.g., in error checking? Same for 
  class('crn'). There is a plot method now. What else?
