o [mvkorpel] Another dummy item
   This one shows how to mark a to-do item as assigned to somebody.
   By default, this seems to show the user's login name.  The notation
   is from todoo.el, an Emacs mode for editing TODO files.  Using the
   mode, it is easy to reorder and hide / show items.  Also in the
   mode, headings of items and sub-items are automatically
   highlighted.  It should be easy enough to adhere to the format even
   if the text editor does not support it.
