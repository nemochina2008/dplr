abstract = {I present and describe a new software package in the R statistical programming environment for dendrochronology. R is considered the world’s pre-eminent open-source statistical computing environment where users can contribute packages, which are freely available on the Internet. The dendrochronology program library in R (dplR) is able to read standard decadal-format files and allows users to perform several standard analyses including interactive detrending, chronology building, and the calculation of standard descriptive statistics. The package can also produce a variety of publication quality plots. The dplR package should make it easier for dendrochronologists to take advantage of R and use it as their primary analytic environment.},

abstract = {I demonstrate new functionality for the Dendrochronology Program Library in R (dplR) that allows for flexible statistical crossdating of tree-ring data. Using a well-dated ring-width file, I give examples of howdplR can be used to examine correlations between each series and a master chronology according to overlapping time periods (segments) specified by the user; examine moving correlations of suspect series; and compute cross-correlation functions to identify specific dating issues. I also show how automatically generated skeleton plots can be used to visually crossdate. Much of the terminology and approach used for crossdating in dplR will be familiar to users of COFECHA.},
